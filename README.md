# 8x8 LED Matrix Controlled by IR Remote using STM32

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project demonstrates the control of an 8x8 LED matrix using an IR remote, managed by an ARM STM32 microcontroller. The project focuses on controlling the text scrolling on the LED matrix with four main functionalities using the IR remote.

## üí° Features

- **Start Displaying Text:** Begin showing text on the LED matrix.
- **Stop Displaying Text:** Halt the text display.
- **Speed Up Scrolling:** Increase the text scrolling speed.
- **Slow Down Scrolling:** Decrease the text scrolling speed.

## üîß Technologies and Protocols Used

- **Microcontroller:** ARM STM32
- **LED Matrix:** 8x8 LED matrix display
- **IR Remote Control:** NEC protocol
- **Programming Language:** C
